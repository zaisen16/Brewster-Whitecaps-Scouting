**Scouting Report Visualizations - Brewster Whitecaps 2025**

This is an example of a few of the visuals we used for daily opponent scouting reports, which I generated through R & Python.

**Video:**
The video portion of this repository is all a project I made, to overlay TrackMan data of each pitch onto the video pulled from Synergy. This was helpful in automating a visual way to show scouting reports while displaying the metrics at the pitch-by-pitch level. It was being shown to hitters daily in order to prepare for the opposing pitcher they would face later that day.

**Rmarkdown graphics:**
This was a simple Rmarkdown file, made to give a very general overview of an opposing pitcher.
